As we have not covered user management yet, the following sites should let all users do everything and all users share the same data.

## Santas List 
Allow Santa to manage a list of children e.g. add, edit and delete names.

Santa should then be able to mark a child as being naughty or nice.

When Santa views the list of children, he should be able to see who is naughty and who is nice.

Santa should be able to easily see the subset of children who he still needs to mark as naughty or nice.

## ToDone 
Let the users create a list of items they need to do
Users can perform CRUD operations on these items

Users can mark an item as done, the site will then show the item as done

Users should be able to priorities tasks, the application should show the tasks with the highest priority first

## FootballMania 
Let users create, edit, delete football teams 
Each team should have a name, logo (image), and league points 

By default the index page lists the teams from most points to least (descending order)
A user can choose to sort them in ascending order.
